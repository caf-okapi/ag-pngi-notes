# Non-Governance

This note aims to establish a definition of non-governance.

In these notes, when we speak of non-governance, we mean that reality does not rest on foundational rules, axioms, or principles that determine what must exist, what is possible, or how things must behave at the most basic level. There is no bottom layer of rules fixing the structure of reality in advance.

Non-governance also does not assume a background space of possibilities upon which governing rules would operate. A pre-existing state-space is already a form of foundational organization. It establishes a structured frame within which everything must fit. Non-governance does not assume such a frame or a single cohesive “base layer” underlying all structure.

Under non-governance, no prior organization is required. What persists, if anything, is not mandated by foundational structure. Non-governance does not suggest that stable structure cannot exist; it suggests only that such structure is not enforced by foundational prescription.
