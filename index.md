# AG-PNGI Notes  
*(Adversarial Generativity – Plural Non-Governance with Interference)*

These are working notes toward a conceptual framework exploring **plural non-governance**, adversarial generativity, and closure.

The guiding question is how stable structures, regularities, and identities can persist in a reality that may lack fundamental governing rules—without reducing such persistence to chaos or arbitrariness.

AG-PNGI does **not** propose new physical laws or experimental predictions. Instead, it offers a way of organizing foundational questions in physics, cosmology, ontology, and identity, and of comparing different possible answers without prematurely committing to axioms.

These notes are provisional and evolving. Concepts may be refined, renamed, or discarded as the framework develops.

## Scope (tentative)

Future notes may explore:
- non-governance vs chaos  
- closure and persistence  
- entropy and stability  
- identity and self-entities  
- cosmology as regime-relative closure  

There is no posting schedule.

## Notes

This site may eventually contain short, focused notes on individual topics. Each note is intended to be self-contained and provisional.
